## Project description 

This project is based on mesurements of muons that decay in a thick absorber at Earthâ€™s surface.
By putting the material in a known magnetic field, the spins of the stopped muons precess in it with the angular velocity  $\omega = g_{\mu} \ \dfrac{eB}{2m_{\mu}}$.
By measuring the distribution of $e^{+}$ in a certain direction as a function of time, it is possible to determine the precession frequency of the muons and from this, its magnetic moment. 
The same distribution mesured without the presence of a magnetic field can instead be used to determine the muon lifetime.

We firstly present a binned analysis of our data, follwed by the unbinned approach. In both cases, we set up a Markov Chain Monte Carlo that allows to extract the muon lifetime and its precession frequency.
